Features

1. Quantum Proof-of-Work (QPOW):
Integrates Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) for nonce creation and quantum-state difficulty adjustment for eco-friendly mining.


2. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):
Transactions secured with Dilithium signatures, ensuring resilience against quantum attacks.


3. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):
Secure communication via teleportation-based key sharing between nodes.


4. Dynamic Sharding:
Automatic scaling with real-time shard performance optimization, providing unparalleled transaction throughput.


5. Quantum AI Optimizer:
Predictive shard load balancing for efficient transaction processing.


6. NFT Marketplace:
Quantum-secured NFT creation and teleportation for unique, tamper-proof assets.


7. Fiat-to-QFC Onramper:
Convert fiat currencies to QFC tokens with integrated KYC/AML checks.

Example Usage

1. Create a Transaction:

wallet = Wallet()  
tx = Transaction("0xSender", "0xRecipient", 50.0)  
tx.sign_transaction(wallet.private_key)


2. Mine a Block:

blockchain = Blockchain(num_shards=3, difficulty=4, total_supply=1_000_000)  
asyncio.run(blockchain.mine_block("miner_address"))


3. Use API with cURL:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"user": "user1", "fiat_amount": 100.0, "currency": "USD"}' \
